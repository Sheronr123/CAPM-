Using OOP I have modelled a way to calculate beta value.

Just to dive deep into theory, holding onto one stock is risky and we should always try to diversify the portfolio. But unfortunately, it still does not get rid of systematic risk which is why the CAPM model is introduced to get the risk denoted by the beta value. 

Beta value shows how much the stock or the portfolio is effected by the market. Calculating and implementing this both has benefits and negatives. If the beta value is between 0-1 relative to the market, then you can take advantage of the bullish market whereas if it is below 0, this a big red flag as returns would inversly be effcted especially when the market conditions are defaulted to SP500 where it is increasing over time meaning the returns would be negative.

Beta value can be calculted using linear regression where beta is defined by the gradient or the covariance matrix between the stock/portfolio and the market.
