Using OOP I have modelled a way to calculate beta value.

Just to dive deep into theory, holding onto one stock is risky and we should always try to diversify the portfolio. But unfortunately, it still does not get rid of systematic risk which is why the CAPM model is introduced to get the risk denoted by the beta value.
